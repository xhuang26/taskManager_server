# Task Manager Server
This is the server side of the Task Manager project, using mlab for data base.

You should be able to do
`npm install` and `nodemon server.js`

Nodemon does auto-reloading the same way grunt does on the frontend.

You might have to install nodemon on the vagrant machine using
`npm install -g nodemon`
